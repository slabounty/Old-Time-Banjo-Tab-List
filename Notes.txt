Generate the data base:
    rm banjotab.sqlite
    sequel -m dbMigration sqlite://banjotab.sqlite
    ruby BanjoBook.rb source_file.csv tunes_file.csv

    or better use Rake
    rake db:clean db:build
  
Reload the data base:
    heroku db:push sqlite://banjotab.sqlite
    heroku restart

Git commands (typical)
    git status # to find out what needs to be "add"ed.
    git add file_1 file_2 # from the status
    git commit -m 'note about why files were changed'
    or (automatically stage files that have been modified)
    git commit -a -m 'note about why files were changed'
    git push origin master # pushes to github
    git push heroku master # pushes to heroku
